The script is a program that arranges arithmetic problems vertically and solves them. It takes a list of arithmetic problems and an optional boolean parameter to decide whether to show the answers or not. The arithmetic problems should be in the form of strings like "32 - 6698", "1 - 3801", "45 + 43", etc.

The function `arithmetic_arranger(problems, show_answers=False)` is the main function of this program. It first checks for various error conditions using helper functions. These error conditions include having more than five problems, using operators other than '+' or '-', having characters other than digits in the numbers, and having numbers with more than four digits. For example, the function `count_error(x: list[str], num: int) -> bool` checks if the number of problems is more than a given number.

```python
if count_error(problems, 5):
    return 'Error: Too many problems.'
```

If no errors are found, the function proceeds to arrange the problems vertically. It does this by first splitting each problem into its constituent parts (the two numbers and the operator), and storing these parts in separate lists. It also calculates the number of spaces needed for each problem to align them properly.

```python
n1 = problem[:index - 1]
n2 = problem[index + 2:]
top.append(n1)
bottom.append(n2)
```

The function then constructs the arranged problems line by line. It first constructs the top line with the first numbers, then the second line with the operators and the second numbers, and then a line of dashes. If the `show_answers` parameter is `True`, it also calculates the answers to the problems and adds a line with the answers.

```python
for _ in range(0, len(problems)):
    for space in range(0, spaces[_] - len(str(top[_]))):
        result.append(" ")
    result.append(top[_])
```

Finally, the function joins all the lines together into a single string and returns this string. The result is a neatly arranged list of arithmetic problems, optionally with their answers.
